		<p>We're back at OU with a Quackathon
			GrizzHacks is a 24 hour engineering marathon, welcome to anyone. Whether you're a seasoned developer building a new idea, a beginner looking to sharpen your skills, or a unrelated major just interested in learning more, we have something for you!
			
			Over the course of 24 hours, each team will build a project from the ground up and then present their work to a panel of judges to compete for prizes! You're allowed to create anything you can think up but if you need some inspiration, check out our tracks this year.
			
			Still have questions? Check out our FAQ.</p>
